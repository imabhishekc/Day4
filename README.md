Telusko 10 day challenge/ #day4_Assignment/Java Spring Web

The last 2 projects by Telusko's 10 day challenge were truly challenging for me due to being an absolute beginner in JAVA. Spring boot and spring web both were very new topics for me but I've tried my best to replicate the project from the session and also tried to add some additional features.
The code here might give some errors.
